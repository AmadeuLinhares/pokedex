## Implementation

The idea of the project was to implement more than as expected, make different, create a possibility the user find pokemons by name, and explore the list of pokemons to identify news and powerfully pokes.

For exemplo, if we have a user that dont know a lot about pokemons, this user wont know what search in our sistem. So, implementing a infinity list, the user could find any pokemons and choice one, or have the first contact with this world. 

So, in addition to this list, we have the core functionality too, where the user typ something and if the system find this pokemon.
